			<h3> DatePicker</h3><br>
			<p> jQueryUI provides datepicker() method that creates  datepicker UI for an
				input. If a date is chosen, feedback is shown as the input's value.
				You can customize the date format and language, restrict the selectable
				date ranges and add in buttons and other navigation options easily. I used the datepicker for the purchase date and repair date selection in the form and addded validation like maxDate to restrict future date selections.</p>

			<h3> "search" feature </h3><br>
			<p> I added a search feature on the FAQ page using the filter() method. The search function searches all questions in a JSON array that match a specified key words entered by the user and the results have been displayed right below the search button with all other questions after it.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="example">
			<h3> Ajax/JSON</h3><br>
			<p> I used a JSON file to store the faq questions and answers and i use Ajax 
				method to retrive the data from the JSON file and display it on a new window when the user clicks the FAQ button.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="example">
			<h3> File upload feature </h3><br>
			<p> I added a file upload option on the form in the repair details section using the input type=file. The files property returns a FileList object, representing the file or files selected with the file upload button.
			Through the FileList object, you can get the name, size and the contents of the files.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="example">
			<h3> HTML Geolocation API </h3><br>
			<p>The HTML Geolocation API is used to locate a userâ€™s position. Since this can compromise privacy, the position is not
			available unless the user approves it. It allows to record the latitude and longitude coordinates of the current location of the user's. I added the location information in the buttons area in which when the page is loaded the longitude and latitude information will be displayed.</p>
